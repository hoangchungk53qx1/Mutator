private val fiveMarkdown = """
The declaration above now defines the unit of state change (Δstate) for any state `T` as a `Mutation`; a lambda with `T` as the receiver that when invoked, returns `T`. The above is extremely powerful as we can represent any state change for any state declaration with a single type.

To produce state then, we simply have to start with an initial state, and incrementally apply state `Mutation`s to it over time to create our state production pipeline. This is sometimes called reducing changes into state.

Expressing this in code with `Flows` is very concise and requires just two operators:


* [`merge`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/merge.html): Used to merge all sources of `Mutation<State>` (Δstate) into a single stream
* [`scan`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/scan.html): Used to reduce the stream of `Mutation<State>` into the state being produced.

In our snail example, we can express the same state production pipeline with user actions as:

## Why `merge`?
    
This example has all the functionality the `combine` approach did, but with a slight complexity cost.

It however brings the following advantages:

* `merge` is an n-ary function; it has no arity limits; you can merge as many `Flow`s as you want.
* New state can be a product of old state; a `Mutation` is an accumulating/reducing function.
* All user actions that change state can share the same source `Flow`: `changeEvents` a [`MutableSharedFlow`](https://kotlinlang.org/api/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-mutable-shared-flow/).
* All source flows can independently contribute their state mutations
* All source flows at the time of introducing the state mutation can read the existing state.
* State changes can come from `Flows` or `suspend` functions easily.

## Why switch to `MutableSharedFlow` from `MutableStateFlow` for user actions?

The switch to `MutableSharedFlow` from `MutableStateFlow` for propagating user actions is because `StateFlow` conflates emissions. If two separate methods attempted to use the same `MutableStateFlow` to emit a `Mutation` of state, the `StateFlow` may only emit the latest `Mutation`. That is `MutableStateFlow` does not guarantee that every update to its `value` property is seen by its collectors.

`MutableSharedFlow` on the other hand has an `emit` method which suspends until the `Mutation` is delivered. This means that multiple coroutines can be launched across several method invocations and call `emit` on the same `MutableShared` `Flow` and none of them will cancel out the other. The order in which they are applied also doesn't matter as `Mutation` instances just describe changes to state; they are designed to be independent.

That is, we can simply introduce a state change to the `progress` property of the state despite the `progessChanges` flow also contributing to a change of the same property. This is something that would be rather difficult with the `combine` approach. This is because the combine approach only lets you set state properties of state to create new state. The `merge` approach instead lets you `mutate` or change properties of state and apply them to the existing state.  
  
Furthermore both `setSnailColor` and `setProgress` contribute their changes to state using the same  `MutableSharedFlow`: `changeEvents`. This approach scales well because no matter how many methods are added that change the `State` from user events, they don't need any more variables to be declared in the state holder class.

## Mutations are flexible updates to state

The method of state production described above may seem unfamiliar at first, however it simply builds on the pattern established in `Snail1` with a single `MutableStateFlow`. It expands the pattern to work not just for state changes from synchronous and `suspend` methods, but for state changes from `Flow` instances as well.

Merging `Mutation` instances can be thought of an extension to `MutableStateFlow.update()`, where updates can come from both `Flows` and `suspend` functions.
