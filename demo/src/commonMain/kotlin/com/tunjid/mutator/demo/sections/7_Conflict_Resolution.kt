# Conflict resolution in state production

There are two ways of dealing with the issue above:


## Lock the state

We can add a new boolean field to the state called `isInterpolating`. If `setMode` is called when `interpolateColors` is running, we return immediately.

This works, but it has the unfortunate side effect of making the user wait until we're done interpolating before they can change the mode again.

## Eliminate the source of conflict

Eliminating the source of conflict in the example above would require being able to stop collecting from `interpolateColors` each time `setMode` is invoked. There are two ways of doing this:

### Cancel the job

In the above `scope.launch()` returns a `Job` for the suspending function that collects from `interpolateColors`. Keeping a reference to this `Job` allows for canceling the `Flow` when next the `setMode` method is invoked.

        mutate { copy(isDark = isDark) }
        interpolateColors(
            ...
        ).collect { (progress, colors) ->
            mutate {
                copy(...)

}

Tap the toggle button many times. Notice that with each tap, the colors reverse their changes.   
""".trimIndent()

private val fiveMarkdown = """
This works, although it has the caveat of something we've seen before; it scales linearly. Each method invocation that could have potential conflicts in state by virtue of it causing multiple changes in state will need a `Job` reference to allow for cancelling collection.


### Model changes with flows

In this approach, the user event of setting the mode is modeled as a `Flow`, and by using the `flatMapLatest` `Flow` operator, the `interpolateColors` `Flow` is automatically canceled each time the `SetMode` `Flow` emits.

In the above, `SetMode` is a summary of the user event. It encapsulates everything needed to process the `Mutation`. The use of `flatMapLatest` cancels any ongoing state changes as a result of previous events and guarantees there are no conflicts.

Scaling the above to cover state production for our snail is non trivial, and often requires a library. In the case of the snail example, applying the concept above yields:

In the above, all there are two sources of state `Mutation`s:

* Data sources in the `inputs` argument; defined as `Flow<Mutation<State>>`
* User events in the `actionTransform` argument; defined as `(Flow<Action>) -> Flow<Mutation<State>>`
   
Crucially the `actionTransform` takes a `Flow` of all `Action` instances, splits them out into individual `Flow`s for each `Action`, and finally applies `Flow` transformations to each `Action` `Flow` to turn them into `Flow<Mutation<State>>`:

* `colorMutations` and `progressMutations` both use `mapLatest` to guarantee no conflicts because `mapLatest` automatically cancels any suspending function invoked in its lambda.
* `modeMutations` does the same as the above but uses `flatMapLatest` and the `flow { }` builder because it collects from a `Flow` instead of just invoking a `suspend` function.

# Choosing a state production pipeline

The above highlights a common motif in this document; the state production pipeline is only as complicated as the kind of state produced, and the state changes that can occur. Simple states require simple pipelines, and complicated states often require higher level abstractions that enforce guarantees in state production. These guarantees often come with a complexity cost.
   
Depending on the particulars of your state production pipeline, a rule of thumb that can be applied is:

### Simple state production pipelines
For small and simple states, `combine` sources that contribute to your state. No library is required.

### Intermediate state production pipelines
For intermediate states that have lots of different kinds of user events, `merge` changes to state so you do not have to create multiple `MutableStateFlow` instances to manage each user event. You may opt to use a library, or roll out a small custom implementation of the techniques described in the *merge* section above.

 ### Large and complex state production pipelines 
 For state production pipelines that:
 * Have multiple contributors to the same state property that may conflict
 * Have user events that can cause multiple mutations of state to occur
 * Have state changes that involve collecting from other `Flow`s
 
 Model your state production pipeline as a `Flow` to allow for tighter control of sources of change, and use a library that offers ergonomic APIs for your transformations.
